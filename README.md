# Optimization-Methods

Optimization Methods for Engineers Project (Spring Semester 23)

The end result of this project is a written [report](report/presentation/report.pdf) in the style of a presentation as well as a simple python library called [sapso](sapso/), which was extensively used for simulating and plotting the conducted experiments.

## TODOs

* [x] SA implementation - debug with plots
* [x] PSO implementation - debug with plots
- [x] PSO code clean up
- [x] clean up TODOs in code
* [x] Combination SA PSO implementation - debug with plots
* [x] search suitable testing functions
* [x] implement plot comparing different optimization methods
* [x] stylize plots coherently for report
* [x] write report
