# Optimization-Methods

Optimization Methods for Engineers Project (Spring Semester 23)

## TODOs

* [x] SA implementation - debug with plots
* [ ] PSO implementation - debug with plots
* [ ] Combination SA PSO implementation - debug with plots
* [ ] search suitable testing functions
* [ ] implement plot comparing different optimization methods
* [ ] stylize plots coherently for report
* [ ] write report

## Testing Functions

For the following cases, (at least) one testing functions is needed.
This allows us to conclude about the **strengths** as well as the **weaknesses** of each method.

- SA is good / bad
- PSO is good / bad
- SAPSO is good / bad
